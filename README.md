### How to Use:

  > python3 main.py

  Large comment blocks at the top of `main.py` are for different paramters for
  different objects, namely the frog, and then the two custom objects, the cow
  and the LED remote.

  To visualize the spatial edge localization and temporal edge localization
  results, uncomment the plt functions in `spatial_shadow.py` in
  `spatial_shadow` and `temporal_shadow` respectively.

### NPZ files:

  > npzs/

  extrinsic_calib.npz - extrinsics
  intrinsic_calib.npz - intrinsics
  plane_pts.npz       - 3D points of the shadow lines
  plane.npz           - shadow planes
